console.log(1+"2"+2) // first number addition then comes a string which converts everything behind it in a string addition thing
//if string is first then everything following will be string addition unless parentheses are added ig. and if string is behind or in between then whatever operation is there in front of it is carried and then string follows

// while comparing two datatypes you should keep both datatypes same
// null == 0 : false null>=0 : true  null>0 : false
//undefined is always false in comparisons like above null


// strict check === checks datatype and value
